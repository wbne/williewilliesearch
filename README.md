## Inspiration
Willie does a *lot* of answering questions especially for niche cases due to external circumstances. In combination with his abundance of projects, Willie may not always be available to help you. Well with this website, you can be at ease as "Willie" (tm) is here to help you out!

## What it does
Just ask Willie a question either in the "WillieTextArea" (tm) for some info from sites online or if you want to see a grade distribution for a class, you can go to the "WillieZone" (tm) and check it out there!

## How I built it
Pure HTML/CSS/JS since this is a light-hearted project that is meant to just play around with some unique ideas and implementations.

## Challenges I ran into
Other obligations aside, thinking about how to use all the currently existing Willie emotes was a challenge in addition to creating the "WillieGIFS" (tm).

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It fits the theme I was aiming for but has the potential to have actual use.

## What we learned
Implementing a custom search engine is easier than I thought.

## What's next for WillieWillieSearch!
RMP craping most likely.
Maybe "WillieVA" (tm) as a feature
No dark mode because Willie uses light mode.
